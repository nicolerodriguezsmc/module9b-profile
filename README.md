# Module 9B – Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It shows a profile card styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX and inline styling in React
- How to create and render a functional component
- How to use useState to add interactivity

## Challenges
I ran into a small issue with commenting inside JSX, but I fixed it by using the proper `{/* comment */}` syntax.
